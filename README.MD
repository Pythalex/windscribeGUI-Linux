# Windscribe GUI for LINUX

Windscribe is a great free-VPN for linux but its CL-only Interface might annoy people like me who discovered the VPN with Windows.
The CLI is clear, convenient and efficient, but I like having the possibilty to check details and tweak things with a GUI, and I hope it could help other people too.

### State : In development (Alpha)

The program is usable mostly for development purpose. You can currently choose a server location, connect and disconnect. But the program suffers from several
latency problems and bugs.
