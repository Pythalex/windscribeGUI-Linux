# Windscribe GUI for LINUX

Windscribe is a great free-VPN for linux but its CL-only Interface might annoy people like me who discovered the VPN with Windows.
The CLI is clear, convenient and efficient, but I like having the possibilty to check details and tweak things with a GUI, and I hope it could help other people too.

### State : In development (Not usable)

Currently the program is not usable, I've done the necessary functions for I/O with windscribe CLI from C code. Now I need to add the most important thing, the GUI.
